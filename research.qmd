My research interest are race and ethnic politics. For this project I argue that the parasocial relationship created between politicians and voters is salient and understudied. I argue that politicians form bonds with voters over things that have nothing to do with politics. I also argue that this is because voters are not paying attention to policy and cannot remember three policy concerns that is tackled by their congress member. As a result, voters remember how they feel about a candidate and I argue that this can translate into vote choice. Preliminary evidence has shown that strong parasocial bonds lead to strong support for candidates. However, I am hoping to take this a step further and see if stronger parasocial bonds can help voters make a decision at the polls over traditional measures such as likeability.
